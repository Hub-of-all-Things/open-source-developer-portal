## Where to start

The HATDEX platform are services built for HAT Microservers to exchange personal data owned and controlled by HAT Owners themselves. Some of the key services relevant to many developers are:

- HAT, the core API service developed to exercise user managed control of your personal data. REST APIs for the HAT schema can be used by web, mobile and other clients to interact with the HAT, allowing the user to control their data and applications benefit from it.
- DEX (the Data EXchange) orchestrating the different data exchange processes in the distributed HAT network, including access brokering for applications and developers
- Milliner, managing provisioning of individual HATs in a tightly secured cloud environment, along with all necessary resources (storage, separate database, networking setup)
