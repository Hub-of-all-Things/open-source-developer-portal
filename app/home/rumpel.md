#Rumpel: The Generic Dashboard

Rumpel is the private dashboard for users HAT data, allowing HAT personal data store customers view and manage their personal information, whilst providing a valuable case study for the viability of the HATs privacy-preserving data infrastructure. Using Rumpel, you can pull in data about yourself from the Internet  Facebook, calendar, photos, just to name a few  into your HAT and view it. You can also use and create actions using the data on the HAT via Rumpel. No one else can use Rumpel to view your HAT data except yourself, as the HAT owner. It is compatible with all computer Operating Systems and it excludes all third parties, advertisements and hard selling. It is also being made available as an open source programme.
