# Knowing the Ecosystem

The HAT Platform operates through four main bodies:

1. HAT users
2. HAT applications
3. The HAT Community Foundation (HCF), the non-profit arm of the HAT Platform
4. HATDeX, a provider of data exchange and transaction clearing services. 

These bodies have distinct, interoperable and interdependent functions within the platform.
