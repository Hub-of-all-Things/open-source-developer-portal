# HAT Data I/O

`HAT` is a data store. That means that you can read and write any data you want. Be it a passport, your health records or any data you can think of. You can learn more about it [here](https://developers.hubofallthings.com/guides/raw_data_io/).

`HAT API Android` has built in support for reading or writing data to your `HAT`

This section describes the mechanism of writing data. For reading, this is done through <a href="03-00-data-debits.html">data-debits</a>, a system of consented data exchange.
