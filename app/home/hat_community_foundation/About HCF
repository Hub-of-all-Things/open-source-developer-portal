# HCF

The HAT Community Foundation, as the non-profit regulatory body governing the HAT Foundation, has four functions – the growth, innovation, representation, and regulation of the HAT Platform. The below section elaborates on its function as a regulator.

The HCF regulates the HAT ecosystem and governs the setting of standards for apps and services that are built on the HAT. The HCF receives registrations for new services and applications built on the HAT. These include: 1. HAT Applications (HAT single sign on) 2. HAT Data Plugs 3. HAT Service Providers, for the provisioning of new HATs 4. HAT Trading Platforms, for the exchange of data between applications and HATs

HCF approves HAT applications and their Servicing Capabilities according to the HAT Ecosystem’s standards of privacy, transparency, security, and ownership, as laid out in the HAT Information Policies in the HAT Code of Practice (CoP).

A rating follows the HAT certification process, indicating the satisfiability with which that service addresses the principals outlined in the CoP. This rating is also subject to HAT users’ reviews. If an application offers computing and processing of personal data, held in a HAT PDMA, and provides the results of that computation directly to the user without sending any data back to the provider itself, it will obtain an A rating in the category of data privacy. However, if a service proposes a data exchange that transact with a user for a set of personal data but takes all of the received data back to its own server for processing, that service will obtain an E rating in the category of data privacy. E category applications will result in an alert to the users of their application status, but there might be perfectly legitimate examples of E-rated data sharing applications, such HR form-filling applications, or surveys.
