#Hat Users

HAT Users set up a HAT to automatically store personal information, privately, and then use it to log in to websites or trade it for goods and services in online marketplaces.


Once a HAT is set up, the HAT user's data is accessible to the HAT user only to view and manage via APIs through HAT dashboard applications like Rumpel or Rumpel Lite, downloadable via the Apple App Store.
