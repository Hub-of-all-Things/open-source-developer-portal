# Developers' Portal

The Developers' Portal is the common starting point for most HAT platform participants. It is accessible via http://developers.hubofallthings.com/.

The Developers' Portal houses all of the supporting documentation and resources a developer or development team may need to build services and apps on that HAT, including a technical description of the ecosystem, developer tools, libraries, API documentation, HATDeX services, and sample codes.

The Developers' Portal also contains a sandbox where development teams can play with sample HATs and APIs, familiarising themselves with access control, testing end-to-end data exchanges, and wrapping such actions into a Data Plug or an application. Data Plugs and apps made outside of the Developers' Portal are also welcome to test its HAT communication and data exchange via the sandbox.

Once a Data Plug or an application is ready, the provider can notify the HCF for certification, allowing full accessibility to the HAT ecosystem.
