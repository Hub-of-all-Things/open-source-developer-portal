# DEX Services

DEX Services are offered by HATDeX and enable applications to become multi-sided markets to trade data between their users and other organizations. These services therefore give HAT applications a trading platform capability: 

### Offer registration
HATDeX can register offers from a Trading Platform application and make registered offers available elsewhere in the ecosystem; 

### Offer status tracking 
HATDeX can report the status of data offers made by Trading Platform applications, including which offer has been claimed or rejected by HAT Users; 

### Billing rules 
HATDeX can facilitate cross-platform billing, such as for offers onboarded from Application A, but claimed via Application B; 

### Data Debit requirement registration
HATDeX can take agreed Data Offers from Data Trading Platforms, configure Data Debit on HATs, and enable the full data exchange at the HAT level; 

### Data transaction stats 
HATDex can track the meta data of a data transaction to update the status of active offers, and it can provide other statistics to trading platforms, including the tracking of offer acceptance, and data yield quantifications; 

### HAT/Data Offer matching control 
HATDeX can maintain a buffer layer to support the offer matching designed by a Trading Platform Application. This control layer carries targeted user data from an offer down to a HAT, and compares the userâ€™s profile against the availability of the HAT data for the data offer. If a match exists, the control layer can display the data offer to the HAT User.
