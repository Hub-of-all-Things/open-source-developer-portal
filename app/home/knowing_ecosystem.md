# Knowing the Ecosystem
The HAT Platform operates through four main bodies;
* HAT users
* HAT applications
* the HAT Community Foundation (HCF) non-profit arm of the HAT Platform
* HATDeX, a provider of data exchange and transaction clearing services. 

These bodies have distinct, interoperable and interdependent functions within the platform.
