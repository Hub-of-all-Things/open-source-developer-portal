#Hat Users

HAT Users set up a HAT to automatically store personal information, privately, and then use it to log in to websites or trade it for goods and services in online marketplaces.


Once setting up a HAT, your data is accessible to you to view and manage via APIs and HAT dashboard applications like Rumpel, downloadable via the Apple App Store.
