# About HAT Users
HAT Users set up a HAT to automatically store personal information, privately, and then use it to log in to websites or trade it for goods and services in online marketplaces.

Once a user sets up a HAT, the data is only accessible to the HAT user to view and manage via APIs and HAT dashboard applications like Rumpel or Rumpel Lite, an app downloadable via the Apple App Store.
