# Data Plugs

In the `HAT` ecosystem, `Data Plug` is a minimal API-to-API web service with the primary purpose of fetching data from 3rd party API and pushing it to individualsâ€™s HAT. Due to the security considerations and limited scope of required functionality, each data plug is granted a write-only access to any particular HAT. You can read more about what a Data Plug is and how to develop one [here](https://developers.hubofallthings.com/guides/building-data-plug/).
