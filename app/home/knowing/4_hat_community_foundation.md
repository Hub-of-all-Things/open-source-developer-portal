#HAT Community Foundation

The HAT Community Foundation, as the non-profit regulatory body governing the HAT Foundation, has four functions: the growth, innovation, representation, and regulation of the HAT Platform. The below section elaborates on its function as a regulator.

The HCF regulates the HAT ecosystem and governs the setting of standards for apps and services that are built on the HAT. The HCF receives registrations for new services and applications built on the HAT. These include: 

1. HAT Applications (HAT single sign on) 
2. HAT Data Plugs 
3. HAT Service Providers, for the provisioning of new HATs 
4. HAT Trading Platforms, for the exchange of data between applications and HATs

HCF approves HAT Applications and their Servicing Capabilities according to the HAT Ecosystem's standards of Security, Confidentiality, Ownership, Transparency and Trust (SCOTT), as laid out in the HAT Information Policies in the HAT Code of Practice (CoP). (The reason that Privacy is not included is that while HATs are private by default, the act of sharing means giving up some of that, and therefore CONFIDENTIALITY, more than privacy, becomes the issue.

A rating follows the HAT certification process, indicating the SCOTT levels for a service that is being rolled out. This rating is also subject to HAT users' reviews. For example, if an application offers computing and processing of personal data, held in a HAT PMDA, and provides the results of that computation directly to the user without sending any data back to the provider itself, it will obtain an A rating in the category of data confidentiality. However, if a service proposes a data exchange that transact with a user for a set of personal data but takes all of the received data back to its own server for processing, that service will obtain an E rating in the category of data confidentiality. E category applications will result in an alert to the users, even if there might be perfectly legitimate examples of E-rated data sharing applications, such HR form-filling applications, or surveys.

Once a service or product has been certified by HCF, it can then be listed on MarketSquare.

## Developers' Portal

The Developers' Portal is the common starting point for most HAT Platform participants. It is accessible via http://developers.hubofallthings.com/.

The Developers' Portal houses all of the supporting documentation and resources a developer or development team may need to build services and apps on that HAT, including a technical description of the ecosystem, developer tools, libraries, API documentation, HATDeX services, and sample codes.

The Developers' Portal also contains a sandbox where development teams can play with sample HATs and APIs, familiarising themselves with access control, testing end-to-end data exchanges, and wrapping such actions into a Data Plug or an application. Data Plugs and apps made outside of the Developers' Portal are also welcome to test its HAT communication and data exchange via the sandbox.

Once a Data Plug or an application is ready, the provider can notify the HCF for certification, allowing full accessibility to the HAT ecosystem.

## MarketSquare

[MarketSquare](https://marketsquare.hubofallthings.net/) is the HCF’s public facing App Store and community centre. Through MarketSquare, the HCF will list all certified applications and publicly accessible ecosystem level statistics, including the number of HATs operating in the ecosystem. MarketSquare is the heart of the HAT platform community, where the four main bodies of the HAT platform come together to interact.

The HAT ecosystem as a whole is designed to allow for and encourage the exchange of personal data. In support of this data economy, the HCF also provides a developers’ portal to facilitate application development.
