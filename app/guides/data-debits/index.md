HAT Data Debits are the cornerstone of consented data exchange. It is _the only_ way data can be retrieved from the HAT by anyone else than the owner and enforces a strictly-defined format defining the specific data requested for the user to review and approve.

The general process of retrieving data using a Data Debit is:

1. Propose a Data Debit including the Data Bundle specification to a HAT
2. The HAT user sees the Data Debit as an unapproved request, reviews it and approves it. Data Debit becomes `enabled`
3. Request Data Debit values from the HAT
4. Optional: If any changes are required to the Data Debit request, submit a request to update it, go back to step 2
