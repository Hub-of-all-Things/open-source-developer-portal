The HAT Milliner Service is the HAT deployment software used in the HATs-on-Demand and HATs-as-a-Service. It was developed by HATDeX to allow more dynamic configuration of HAT deployment such as for example, default allocated storage for each HAT, mechanism for starting and managing HAT and rules for HAT backup and recovery.

Your organisation may obtain a license from HATDeX to provision HATs directly from your apps much like HaaS, but to host HATs on your existing or preferred cloud infrastructure.

This guide outlines how Milliner integrates with your infrastructure for HAT provisioning in three steps:

1. Signing up a new user with Milliner
2. Starting a HAT with all necessary resources
3. Registering the HAT with the Data EXchange (DEX)
