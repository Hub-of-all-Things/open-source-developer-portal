HAT and why Build on It?</h1><h5 id=why-build-something-on-the-hat-interacting-with-personal-data-made-easy-developing-smarter-applications-on-hats-with-hat-platform-services>Why build something on the HAT â€“ Interacting with personal data made easy - Developing smarter applications on HATs with HAT platform services</h5><p><a href="http://www.hatdex.org/what-is-the-hat/">HAT</a>, in the development sense, represents the HAT ecosystem that facilitates personal data exchange. This includes the provisioning of PDMA; infrastructure for market exchange facilitating inter-organisational and organisational-individual data exchange, and tools, apps, and services for private data use. This allows the ecosystem to be positioned as a multi-sided personal data exchange platform, to allows individuals to collect, visualise, control their personal data in exchange for better services (such as viewing activities via <a href="http://www.hatdex.org/rumpel-hyperdata-browsing-personal-dashboard-internet/">Rumpel</a>, organising daily activities, managing social media, notes, blogs, and much more in the future). On the other side, this also provides a platform, with the ability for organisations to create a Data Plugs to give personal data back to individuals, and to offer services by accessing more and better quality personal data via apps, views, etc. This may sound rather a simple and straightforward proposition for any two-sided market driven by personal information. But companies who have operated to provide a service to consumers had to build a lot in order to achieve this. For example, 1. There is a need for an app to interface and interact with individuals. 2. And all the plumbing behind the scenes needs to happen to collect, link up and host personal data, content and assets in some infrastructure, as well as taking care of the legal and security aspect, before the creation of a service for the individual from accessing and processing the data. 3. OR it is possible to build such service by going around organisations who already holds personal data and linking them all up, although the stability of data access may be challenging when providers can change the T&amp;Cs at any time. 4. Alternatively, it can be simpler if business build such services from an existing platform. However, that simplicity can be over shadowed by a whole lot of privacy issues and leave the businesses at risk of impropriating handling of personal data.</p><p>The options available rather problematic, especially for those businesses who are keen to participate but not yet having any substantial stake in this personal data economy. To provide better (even personalised) services to customers would require building a direct and better relationship with customers. But rather heavy development (such as 1 and 2) may take the focus away from developing the services required. While an easy ride on the lightweight plumbing (such as 3 or 4 above) would lead to hardly any relationship with customers, as the data is held by 3rd party businesses, and service designed customers would also become platform dependant (on which platform services sit on). Having gone through such issues ourselves, we are determined to position the HAT as one platform that overcome such issue by ensuring businesses should only need to work with one set of APIs for ALL kinds of personal data and content to service customers DIRECTLY. The ability to DIRECT interact with customers personal data and preference will help businesses to go beyond just giving a customer a service but HOW to best serve a customer in context in time, and to create stickiness to the end customer rather than other companies that holding the data. Therefore, we (HAT Community Foundation) have developed those moving parts that businesses would otherwise have to plumb, combined them as a number of underlining platform services, and made them available as a set of APIs so that every business can come into the HAT platform and deals with customer directly.
