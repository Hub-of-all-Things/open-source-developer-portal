# About the Hat

A Personal Data Management System (“the HAT”) is a personal single tenant (“the individual self”) technology system that is fully individual self-service, to enable an individual to define a full set of “meta-data” defining as a specific set of personal data, personal preferences, personal behaviour events. The HAT allows individuals to share the right information (quality and quantity), with the right people, in the right situations for the right purposes and gain the benefits.

The HAT and its personal data ecosystem is designed to allow individual HAT Users to collect, contextualise and exchange their personal data. The enabling technology for the HAT sits within the HATPDP, (mostly referred as “HAT”). The Personal HAT is a person “oriented” personal data platform, owned by the individuals, that allows us to unpick the silos in which our personal data sits and to collect all this data which we can acquire from internet-connected objects or services. The HAT then allow the transformation of this acquired data for individuals to contextualise and organise, to make it meaningful and useful for control decisions and actions. With that data, individuals can buy apps to analyse, view, create scenarios, trade or make important decisions based on our own data for a smarter and more effective life. The HAT is therefore a fully scalable platform that allows firms to offer individuals services for our personal data, and yet enables us as individuals to personalise that data to our own needs.

The APIs detailed in this document detail how this functionality is achieved.
