# Rumpel

[Harriet Project](http://hatresearch.org/Harriet/) team initiated the creation of [RUMPEL](https://github.com/Hub-of-all-Things/Rumpel) - the private dashboard for users' HAT data, allowing HAT personal data store customers view and manage their personal information, whilst providing a valuable case study for the viability of the HAT's privacy-preserving data infrastructure. It is made available as an open source programme, under Mozilla Public License.
