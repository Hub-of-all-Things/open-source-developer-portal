# Some Cool Apps

We have heard many cool applications that could mix HAT data into other services. To name a few: 

* An automated service can provide data for websites, sharing bundles of data without users entering them again, nor will it allow the dodgy companies from hoovering up our data/cookies and reselling them. 

* A switching app that that can benchmark a bundle of HAT data against aggregate data, and suggest better service providers such insurance, without us exposing other details and email address to be bombarded with junk emails and calls
* A supermarket app that collects shopping history, and pre-fills a shopping basket for a user, or even send us a reminder

* A banking app that integrates online shopping details and transaction record, to provide advise better account options, or better personal finance 

* A government gateway app that collects our basic information for accessing public service, but only under our consent.
