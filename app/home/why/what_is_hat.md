The HAT microserver is a new technology that confers intellectual property rights of personal data to individuals through their ownership of a database, wrapped with containerised microservices. The HAT microserver is fully portable across devices, but is commonly hosted in the cloud. It is provisioned by a trust anchor and by way of its legal, economic and technology architecture, the personal data within can be legally owned, controlled and processed by individuals. Individuals can install plugs to bring their data in from the Internet, exchange data with applications through data debits and install tools in their microservers to have private AI for insights into their data, their health, their history and their memories. The HAT is fully open sourced but services in the HAT ecosystem are built by commercial as well as non-profit organisations.

The HAT was developed through more than £3m RCUK Digital Economy-funded research projects involving six universities: Cambridge, Edinburgh, Nottingham, Surrey, Warwick, and UWE. 

### How HATs are different

Legally owned, fully controlled by individuals:

- The HAT microserver is a powerful software device and an Internet server with the individual’s own URL e.g. https://andrius.hubofallthings.net
- Legal ownership of the HAT Microserver database rights, with full rights to its content and therefore part of the individual’s estate. Individuals can donate their data to research or be a guardian of their child's database as a minor 
- Legally act as a data controller and processor of the data in their HATs, so they can request for data legally, instead of through a third party service
- The HAT Platform provider enable HATs to be issued by HAT Issuers, and for HAT data to be used by HAT Merchants.

A revolutionary way of conducting data exchanges on the Internet:

- Accept a data exchange of any kind, and of any size, be it a single location point, a tweet, or a review of a product through a note
- Accept a data exchange without revealing identity, e.g. shopping list or location, to get personalised recommendations while remaining private
- Data exchange contract is logged and the license to use the data is given by individuals themselves

### What problem does the HAT solve

- Economic power back to individuals so that they can reward organisations that use data ethically, transparently and create valuable services with the data
- Efficiency for individuals. The ability to use their data again and again to fill in forms, or get personalised recommendations
- Private by default. Organisations that ask HAT Owners for data can choose to INQUIRE data in real time and on demand, instead of ACQUIRING it.
- Reduce privacy risks. Exchange data for as long as individuals want to, e.g. to check into a hotel, or to post a notice on social media, and stop exchanging when the other party no longer needs it.

### What opportunities do HATs give

- Stimulate innovation in the data economy. New data services/apps can be created, which are privacy preserving without the need to build user accounts
- Build trust. New privacy-preserving data driven apps that do not need identity can be created. 
- Reduce privacy leaking. HAT to HAT interactions can be completely private without leaking information or data to a third party service

### What is the goal

The goal is to create a new generation of services on the Internet running on HAT microservers. 

### How secure is the HAT

Security is at the core of the HAT and HAT Platform Providers follow industry best practices to secure the environment where HATs are provisioned. Milliner as a recognised solution for implementing security requirements provides a [detailed questionnaire](../tech-stack/milliner.html) of the comprehensive security measures used.

### Who is HATDeX

HATDeX is the operator of the HAT trust framework. It built all the infrastructure services for the provisioning of HAT Microservers and the facilitation of on-demand, real-time personal data and content exchanges. The HATDeX platform is the technology, legal and economic infrastructure for data sharing between HAT Microservers and HAT enabled applications https://hatdex.org 

### Who is HAT Community Foundation

The HAT Community Foundation (HCF) regulates the HAT ecosystem. It certifies all partner tools, apps and plugs and approves all changes to the platform terms of service. https://hatcommunity.org
