# Rating System

HAT Community Foundation (HCF) is developing a rating system for applications and services “powered by HAT”. As it matures, the scheme will be akin to the credit rating scheme in financial services, but in the case of HAT it will represent the “credit worthiness” of data buyers, either directly, or through applications, to be granted access to an individual’s data. It will provide a rough indication of: the security of the data held by data buyers and applications; and the transparency of what the data buyer will do with the personal data credited to him, the privacy of the data sat within the application/data buyer’s system, and the ownership of the data that sits within the application/data buyer’s system.

Any organisation providing HATs or services “on the HAT” is able to operate only if they comply with a minimum standard for security, privacy, ownership, confidentiality, transparency and trust (SPOCTT) set out in the HAT Code of Practice maintained by HCF. This provides all users within the ecosystem assurance that their data transactions are subject to a basic but comprehensive level of compliance to . The rating scheme goes beyond this to give users an “at a glance” indication of the quality of data offers posted by accredited data shoppers. The rating system is empirical, evidence-based and evolving.
Incentives and Alignments

It is also important to check how and why the HAT data leaves the platform. Some apps may require you to give the data away, for example, when you do a survey, fill in forms etc. It is important that the rating checks if the business model of the provider is aligned with the data they receive. For example, giving you a flashlight app for your phone does not give the provider the right to hoover up all your personal data.
