# Why build something on the HAT

### Rich, horizontal data

In effect, the HAT gives developers a way to gain all of the benefits of having a rich, personal data set about their users without having to actually own, protect, or store any of that data themselves.

The HAT is ideal for advanced consumer applications that thrive on prediction, and personalised services. It can help developers gain much deeper customer understanding, whilst at the same time vastly reducing their cyber security risk and development overhead, while ensuring that they only ask for data relevant to the service provided.

### Out-of-the-box authentication

The HAT solves user authentication and account provisioning out-of-the-box, letting you focus your development time on building a great application.

### Security

Remove as much of the cyber security risk your customers face as is humanly possible. Your users' personal information Ð no matter how sensitive Ð will be stored in private, containerised databases that are protected by the most sophisticated security and encryption protocols possible. What's more, the containerisation of these databases de-incentivises cyber attack, as each breach yields only one record's net return.

### API-as-a-backend

The HAT makes prototyping and MVP-creation as easy as possible, by giving you a database framework that looks like a simple API. All you have to do is put together a frontend application that calls data from the APIs and you're ready to go.

### Build what cannot be built

Ultimately, the promise of the HAT is that you can start to build the impossible. The HAT can generate valuable contextualised mixed data sets, owned and controlled by the user, that have previously only been partially available to corporations. Now they can be a part of your team's applications as well.

### Customer acquisition support

HAT-enabled applications benefit from a rapidly-growing pool of consumer Internet services customers. By growing your technology from within this ecosystem, you can leverage this community to create an early pool of new users, just by listing your application in MarketSquare (HAT's public app store) and creating Data Offers that showcase your application.

### Top-tier engineering and developers

The HAT is built by some of the best technical developers and engineers in the world. Grow your world-changing consumer technology alongside them, by joining our internal developers' community; leverage them for advice and insight, and vet your technology against their expertise.

### Middleware

HAT PDMAs (Private Data Microservice Accounts) also feature data and metadata analysis tools that can be leveraged by app developers for some specialised tasks, like machine learning and personalisation.

Businesses would otherwise have to plumb and combine all kinds of data sets from disparate sources to make personal data usable and deal with issues of privacy, security as well. Details see the [ecosystem architecture](knowing_ecosystem.html), and the [tools available](HAT_core.html).

Leveraging the tools and existing processes, now developers can focus on data exchange and engagement with HATs simply through a few API calls.
