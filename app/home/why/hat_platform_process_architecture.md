The HATDeX platform is a technology suite of services that is designed to manage and coordinate HATs as well as to achieve seamless data exchange.

The HATs themselves are decentralised microservers - each consisting of storage encapsulated by microservices. Every HAT microserver is controlled and owned by 1 HAT owner.
