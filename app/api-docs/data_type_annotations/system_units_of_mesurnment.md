# Funding source verification

Before an Access API Customer is eligible to transfer money from their bank or credit union account they need to verify ownership of the account, either via Instant Account Verification (IAV) or micro-deposits. This article demonstrates how to verify a bank or credit union account using either of these options. **Please note:** IAV within dwolla.js is a premium feature only available for Access API customers. For more information about the Access API and IAV, please [contact sales](https://www.dwolla.com/contact).

In this article we use the example of verifying an Access API Customer's bank account and detail the interaction between Dwolla, your application, and the Access API Customer.
