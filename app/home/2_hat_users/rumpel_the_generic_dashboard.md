# Rumpel, the generic dashboard
[RUMPEL](https://github.com/Hub-of-all-Things/Rumpel) - the private dashboard for users' HAT data, allow HAT users view and manage their personal information, whilst providing a valuable case study for the viability of the HAT's privacy-preserving data infrastructure.

Rumpel is also the baseline dashboard that all HAT Service Providers have to provide, and they can re-skin and change it the way they wish as long as the core functionalities of the HAT Dashboard is available to their users.
