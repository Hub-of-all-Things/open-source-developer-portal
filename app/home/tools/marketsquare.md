# MarketSquare

The [HAT MarketSquare](https://marketsquare.hubofallthings.com) is where the community of developers, organisations and even users gather. It is the central place where HAT Applications, Data Plugs and Data Offers are listed, and where the community learn from one another through blog posts and other knowledge-base repositories.

Through MarketSquare, the HCF will list all certified applications and publicly accessible ecosystem level statistics, including the number of HATs operating in the ecosystem. MarketSquare is the heart of the HAT platform community, where the four main bodies of the HAT platform come together to interact.

The HAT ecosystem as a whole is designed to allow for and encourage the exchange of personal data. In support of this data economy, the HCF also provides a Developersâ€™ Portal to facilitate application development.
