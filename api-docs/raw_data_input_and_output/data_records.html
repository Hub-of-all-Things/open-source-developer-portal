For visual explanation of what Data Record is, see the diagram in Raw Data Input and Output introduction above.</p><h3 id=record-structure>Record Structure</h3><p>All Record API calls contain all the information defined in Record Structure. If you want to create a new Record, you have to include all the mandatory information in the API request. Record structure is explained in the table below.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Parameter</th><th>Description</th><th>Optional/Mandatory</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>id</td><td>table ID in the system</td><td>optional</td></tr><tr><td>dateCreated</td><td>date when the table was created</td><td>optional</td></tr><tr><td>lastUpdated</td><td>date when the record was updated</td><td>optional</td></tr><tr><td>name</td><td>name of the record</td><td>mandatory</td></tr></tbody></table><h3 id=creating-a-new-record>Creating a new Record</h3><p>You should create a new record for every set of Values you want to be treated as a single record. For example, each GPS reading with separate longitude and latitude Values can be put in a Record that contains both longitude and latitude, together with additional properties such as the timestamp of the Record. To create a new Record, the API request body should contain a new Record name and it should be posted to /data/record endpoint. The new Record ID and times when it was created as well as updated will be recorded automatically and included in the response.</p><h3 id=filling-data-structures>Filling Data Structures</h3><p>Currently the easiest way of putting new data into the HAT is to POST it to the /record/RECORDID/values API endpoint, formatted as in the provided examples. RECORDID is extracted separately for each Record from the response of the API call to create a new Record. In this case you submit a list of values that each contain the value itself and the field it should be putin, together with its ID and name.</p><p>Because multiple Data Fields can have the same name but different IDs, ID is mandatory to disambiguate where exactly data should be inserted.</p><h3 id=creating-a-new-record-and-filling-its-data-structures-together>Creating a New Record and Filling its Data Structures Together</h3><p>If data structure Values are known before a new Record needs to be created, it tends to be useful to create a new Record and fill its data structures with Values in one go. To do this, the API request body should contain a new Record name and a list of values and it should be posted to /data/record/values endpoint. The new Record ID and times when it was created as well as updated will be recorded automatically and included in the response. Note that you can create a list of new Records by simply defining a list of them in the API request body.</p><p>The API accepts a list of pairs of Records with values.</p><p>Because multiple Data Fields can have the same name but different IDs, ID is mandatory to disambiguate where exactly data should be inserted.</p>
