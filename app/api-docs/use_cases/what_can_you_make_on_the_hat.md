# What can you make on the HAT?

Every aspect within the ecosystem presents opportunities for innovators. The most common form is an app. Our existing partners are making apps on HAT, for example [b.heard] (Every aspect within the ecosystem presents opportunities for innovators. The most common form is an app. Our existing partners are making apps on HAT, for example [b.heard] (http://www.hatdex.org/2017/01/24/b-heard-champions-personal-data-empowerment-new-hat-provider/) and [Noggin] (http://www.hatdex.org/2017/02/06/noggin-hatdex-sign-mou/). 

*	A HAT App

   In a nutshell, it may communicate with users’ hats, request data access to those hats, and in exchange, making an attractive offer or providing some benefits to the hat owner. An app may consists a few functions, can also be built independently, including
   1.	A data plug – [link to common data plug data plug]. For example, a facebook data plug that pulls facebook data into a HAT.
   2.	Views – a visual interface to allow users to view their own data. This could be a brand new view back-to-back with a new data plug, or even a brand new dashboard for hats, so that users can grasp some ideas about new data collected in their hats. For example, B.Heard offers a view of data collected by the b.heard plug. Or it could be some improved views for existing data, in order to help users to form better understanding of existing data sets. i.e. Rumpel web’s a mashup view combining calendar events, location, and social updates. 
   Note: views are usually built on existing dashboards. Feel free to contact our development partners for collaboration. [link to the partners page]
   3.	Data Mates
   A smarter version of views. Data Mates analyses a stream of data, forms intelligences from the data and suggests nudges for actions. For example, a greenspace data mate could help improving someone’s wellbeing by suggesting a lunchtime walk (spotted free slot from the calendar) around the user’s current location, due to the lack of time spent around greenspace within the week.  
   4.	Data bots
   Automated actions for data processing. A data bot usually releases hat users from repetitive or routinely performed actions. For example, a data bot for form filling can help users to fill in forms that requests known data (subject to users’ consent).  

We have heard many cool applications that could mix HAT data into other services. To name a few: 
  * An automated service can provide data for websites, sharing bundles of data without users entering them again, nor will it allow the dodgy companies from hoovering up our data/cookies and reselling them. 
  * A switching app that that can benchmark a bundle of HAT data against aggregate data, and suggest better service providers such insurance, without us exposing other details and email address to be bombarded with junk emails and calls
  * A supermarket app that collects shopping history, and pre-fills a shopping basket for a user, or even send us a reminder
  *	A banking app that integrates online shopping details and transaction record, to provide advise better account options, or better personal finance 
  *	A government gateway app that collects our basic information for accessing public service, but only under our consent.
