# Privacy Notice – HAT Owner Services and HAT accounts

This Privacy Notice sets out the basis on which we will treat:

- personal data (&quot;personal data&quot;) collected by or submitted to the HAT dashboard and extensions of HAT dashboards such as HAT Wrapper Services and Rumpel (the &quot;Owner Services&quot;); and
- personal data (&quot;HAT personal data&quot;) uploaded to a user&#39;s HAT private micro-server account (&quot;HAT Account&quot;).

The Owner Services are web or mobile applications that allow the HAT owner to view the data in their HAT account. Except when used for performance improvements, the Owner Services do not store any HAT personal data.

Note there is a separate privacy notice dealing with personal data collected when you interact with our websites.

## Who we are

For the purpose of the Data Protection Act 1998 (the &quot;Act&quot;), the data controller for the Owner Services is HAT Data Exchange Ltd (&quot;we&quot;, &quot;us&quot; or &quot;our&quot;).  We are a private limited company registered in England and Wales under company number 09821157 and have our registered office at The Cottages, 8 Comberton Road, Barton, Cambridge, CB23 7BA.

## HAT Owner usage of owner services

You can only access the Owner Services if you are the holder of a HAT Account (HAT Owner&quot;).

Regarding the personal data, such as your name and email address (and if applicable payment information), that you provide during account creation, we will only use this to provide your HAT Account and associated Owner Services.  For the purposes of the Act, we will be the data controller of this personal data.

You are in control of all the HAT personal data within your HAT Account.  This means you decide what HAT personal data is collected, how and why it is processed, how long it is stored and when it is deleted or shared with anyone else.

We commit to using appropriate technical and organisational measures to prevent unauthorised access to or accidental loss, destruction or damage to your HAT personal data contained in your HAT Account. We do not control or have insight into the type of HAT personal data you collect or process in your HAT Account, we encourage HAT Owners to familiarise themselves with the security standards and check these are appropriate to your intended activities.

You can control any data exposure of your HAT Personal Data and the associated functionality of your HAT Account using the HAT Owner Services. We classify data exposure and functionality using the 5 levels described below and you can find more information, including additional information on setting the levels at [http://www.hatdex.org/general-platform-operating-procedures/](http://www.hatdex.org/general-platform-operating-procedures/).

#### HAT Level 0, zero exposure/functionality

Data stored in your HAT Account is private and cannot be accessed by any third party or services.  Even we will not know if the HAT Account is operational, so you will need to tell us if the HAT Account is down or experiencing problems.  You will only be able to view the data through a service or other access mechanism you create. This option is only open to advanced developers/HAT owners.

#### HAT Level 1, minimal exposure/functionality [Owner Services only]

Data stored in your HAT Account is private and only you can access and view the data using Owner Services.  Non-personally identifiable metadata will be reported as part of the HAT ecosystem statistics.

#### HAT Level 2, low exposure/functionality [Owner Services and data plugs]

Data stored in your HAT Account is private and you can access and view the data using Owner Services.  Non-personally identifiable metadata will be reported as part of the HAT ecosystem statistics.

You can collect and bring data, including personal data, into your HAT Account using data plugs you authorise and control.  When executing the functionality of the data plug personal data may be processed in transit on our system, but will not be stored or processed for any reason other than to bring the data into your HAT Account.

#### HAT Level 3, medium exposure/functionality [Owner Services, data plugs and data debits]

Data stored in your HAT Account is private and you can access and view the data using Owner Services.  Non-personally identifiable metadata will be reported as part of the HAT ecosystem statistics.

You can collect and bring data, including personal data, into your HAT Account using data plugs you authorise and control.  When executing the functionality of the data plug personal data may be processed in transit on our system, but will not be stored or processed for any reason other than to bring the data into your HAT Account.

You can authorise the sharing of your data, including personal data, with third parties such as your friends and family or in response to data offers through data debits.  We will follow the instructions you give us regarding the data, which will be encrypted while in transit via, or stored on our systems and only viewable or accessible by the third party with whom you have agreed to share the data.

#### HAT Level 4, high exposure/functionality [Owner Services, data plugs and rolling data debits]

Data stored in your HAT Account is private and you can access and view the data using HAT Owner Services.  Non-personally identifiable metadata will be reported as part of the HAT ecosystem statistics.

You can collect and bring data, including personal data, into your HAT Account using data plugs you authorise and control. We will not process such data – we will merely enable it to transit through our system – it may be stored but only as necessary in order to bring the data into your HAT Account.

You can authorise the sharing of your data, including personal data, with third parties such as your friends and family or in response to data offers.  We will follow the instructions you give us regarding the data, which will be encrypted while in transit via, or stored on our systems and only viewable or accessible by the third party with whom you have agreed to share the data.  Such instructions can include an authorisation **for the ongoing bundling and sharing** of your personal data with a third party you have approved for a defined period of time.
