Use the [Function Testing](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/110376/RWTiveWS) postman collection we have prepared for this purpose!

You will need to configure the function environment with your own function's API gateway details, choose the HAT you want to use for testing and update HAT credentials for the whole collection to run successfully. Once you are satisfied that it works correctly, [contact us](mailto:contact@hatdex.org) to have it reviewed and integrated!
