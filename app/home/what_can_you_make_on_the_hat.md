#What can you make on the HAT?

Every aspect within the ecosystem presents opportunities for innovators. The most common form is an app. Our existing partners are making apps on HAT, for example [b.heard] (https://www.bheard.com/) and [Noggin] (http://www.hatdex.org/2017/02/06/noggin-hatdex-sign-mou/). 

*A HAT App
   In a nutshell, it may communicate with users hats, request data access to those hats, and in exchange, making an attractive offer or providing some benefits to the hat owner. An app may consists a few functions, can also be built independently, including

   1. [A DataPlug](http://developers.hubofallthings.com/documentation/how_to_build_a_data_plug.html). For example, a facebook data plug that pulls facebook data into a HAT.
   2.Views:
   A visual interface to allow users to view their own data. This could be a brand new view back-to-back with a new data plug, or even a brand new dashboard for hats, so that users can grasp some ideas about new data collected in their hats. For example, B.Heard offers a view of data collected by the b.heard plug. Or it could be some improved views for existing data, in order to help users to form better understanding of existing data sets. i.e. Rumpel webs a mashup view combining calendar events, location, and social updates. 
   Note: views are usually built on existing dashboards. Feel free to contact our development partners for collaboration. 
   3. Data Mates
   A smarter version of views. Data Mates analyses a stream of data, forms intelligences from the data and suggests nudges for actions. For example, a greenspace data mate could help improving someones wellbeing by suggesting a lunchtime walk (spotted free slot from the calendar) around the users current location, due to the lack of time spent around greenspace within the week.  
   4. Data Bots
   Automated actions for data processing. A data bot usually releases hat users from repetitive or routinely performed actions. For example, a data bot for form filling can help users to fill in forms that requests known data (subject to users consent).
