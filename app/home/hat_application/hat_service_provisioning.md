# HAT Service Provisioning

The HAT Application providers may offer HATs for HAT users directly from their apps. HAT Application providers can choose to provision HATs from their own preferred infrastructure (and become a HAT Service Provider), or buy HATs on demand from existing HAT Service Providers.
