# About HAT App

HAT Applications provide web applications and services directly to users, functioning like ‘normal’ applications except that the user account for a HAT Application is a HAT PDMA (private ‘microserver’ data account. Within the HAT Ecosystem, a HAT user owns their HAT and is the sole party with login permission to their PDMA. Only they can view and interact with the data stored there, only they can manage their incoming data (through Data Plugs) or create new data (through the use of HAT Applications), and only they can control their PDMA’s data exchanges. 

HAT Applications often provide branded applications with which the user can interface with the HAT and conduct all of these activities.
