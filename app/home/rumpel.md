# Rumpel

Rumpel is the private dashboard for users HAT data, allowing HAT personal data store customers view and manage their personal information, whilst providing a valuable case study for the viability of the HATs privacy-preserving data infrastructure. Using Rumpel, you can pull in data about yourself from the Internet  Facebook, calendar, photos, just to name a few  into your HAT and view it. You can also use and create actions using the data on the HAT via Rumpel. No one else can use Rumpel to view your HAT data except yourself, as the HAT owner. It is compatible with all computer Operating Systems and it excludes all third parties, advertisements and hard selling. It is also being made available as an open source programme.

[Harriet Project](http://hubofallthings.com/Harriet) team initiated the creation of [RUMPEL](https://github.com/Hub-of-all-Things/rumpel) - a hyper data browser for your HAT data. No one else can use RUMPEL to view your HAT data except yourself, as the HAT owner. It is compatible with all computer Operating Systems and it excludes all third parties, advertisements and ‘hard selling’. It is also being made available as an open source programme, under Mozilla Public License.
Personal Data is a combination of various information: your location on your phone, your Facebook postings, the music you listen to, etc. But we have never seen all of this data in one place! So when we do not have a way of seeing our data, we do not feel precious about it. It is like seeing bits of your clothing all over the place, but only when they come together in your wardrobe do you realise you have some good stuff and you can mix and match for your own benefit. Rumpel therefore fulfils this important psychological function with your Personal Data - making it your own HyperData Browser (our personal data wardrobe) with good data visualisations of your own data and allowing you to create bundles and collections. And in so doing, Rumpel must be able to "spin straw to gold" - to make the human being feel her / his data has value to herself / himself.

There are many people who want to sell their data because they think it is valuable to firms. What they do not understand is that an exchange of a precious commodity can happen only when both sides value the data.  If Rumpel can make you see real value of the data to yourself, you will demand more in exchange for it. But more importantly, the firms would also find your contextualised data more valuable!
