# Rumpel

[Harriet Project](http://hatresearch.org/Harriet/) team initiated the creation of [RUMPEL](https://github.com/Hub-of-all-Things/Rumpel) - the private dashboard for users' HAT data, allowing HAT personal data store customers view and manage their personal information, whilst providing a valuable case study for the viability of the HAT's privacy-preserving data infrastructure. It is made available as an open source programme, under Mozilla Public License.

Rumpel is also the baseline dashboard that all HAT Service Providers have to provide, and they can re-skin and change it the way they wish as long as the core functionalities of the HAT Dashboard is available to their users.
