# Hat Users

HAT Users set up a HAT to automatically store personal information, privately, and then use it to log in to websites or trade it for goods and services in online marketplaces.


Once a HAT is set up, the HAT user's data is accessible to the HAT user only to view and manage via APIs through HAT dashboard applications like Rumpel or Rumpel Lite, downloadable via the Apple App Store.

## About HAT Users
HAT Users set up a HAT to automatically store personal information, privately, and then use it to log in to websites or trade it for goods and services in online marketplaces.

Once a user sets up a HAT, the data is only accessible to the HAT user to view and manage via APIs and HAT dashboard applications like Rumpel or Rumpel Lite, an app downloadable via the Apple App Store.

## Rumpel Lite for iOS

[Rumpel Lite](https://github.com/Hub-of-all-Things/RumpelLite) is an iOS demonstrator app for the HAT, powered by Rumpel dashboard. It is used to give a demonstration of any new HAT, DEX APIs or any new functionality that becomes available on the HAT ecosystem that can be used across all HAT applications. Currently, one can use Rumpel Lite to:

* Download and configure a HAT - private, personal data containers for storing consumer information generated on the Internet  
* Securely store and maintain your own personal information
* Gather and capture information that's created about you by internet services like Facebook and Twitter
* Monitor and retain iOS sensor data about your location 
* Store and publish text-based notes and updates

It is made available as an open source programme, under Mozilla Public License. HAT Applications and Service Providers can modify Rumpel Lite to suit their own applications and use cases.

## Rumpel, the generic dashboard
[RUMPEL](https://github.com/Hub-of-all-Things/Rumpel) - the private dashboard for users' HAT data, allows HAT users to view and manage their personal information, whilst providing a valuable case study for the viability of the HAT's privacy-preserving data infrastructure. It is made available as an open source programme, under Mozilla Public License.

Rumpel is also the baseline dashboard that all HAT Service Providers have to provide. They can re-skin and change it the way they wish as long as the core functionalities of the HAT Dashboard are available to their users.
