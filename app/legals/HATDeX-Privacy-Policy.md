## Governing law

These Terms are governed by English law except for its conflicts of laws principles, unless otherwise required by a mandatory law of any other jurisdiction.

## Dispute settlement

1. HATDeX wants to address the User&#39;s concerns without needing a formal legal case. If a dispute arises out of the Terms, before filing a claim against HATDeX, the User agrees to attempt to resolve the dispute informally by contacting info@HATDeX.org. HATDeX will make any effort to achieve an amicable solution to the dispute. If the dispute is not resolved informally within 15 days from the date of the first email concerning such a dispute, the User and HATDeX are entitled to start legal proceedings.
2. Any dispute arising out of the Terms, which is not resolved amicably in accordance with the preceding paragraph, is subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the competent English Court the User may only resolve disputes with us on an individual basis and may not bring a claim as a plaintiff or a class member in a class, consolidated or representative action. Class arbitrations, class actions, private attorney general actions and consolidation with other arbitrations are not allowed.

## Waiver, severability and assignment

HATDeX&#39;s failure to enforce a provision of the Terms does not waive its right to do so later. If a provision is found unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the Terms will remain in full effect and an enforceable term will be substituted reflecting our intent as closely as possible. The User may not assign any of their rights under these Terms, and any such attempt will be void. HATDeX may assign its rights to any of its affiliates or subsidiaries, or to any successor in interest of any business associated with the Services.

## Modifications to the terms

HATDeX may revise these Terms at any time, and will always post the most current version on its website. If a revision meaningfully reduces your rights, we will notify you (by, for example, sending a message to the email address associated with your account, posting on our blog or on this page). By continuing to use or access the Services after the revisions come into effect, the User agrees to be bound by the revised Terms.

## Entire agreement

These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and HATDeX with respect to the subject matter of these Terms, and supersede and replace any other prior or contemporaneous agreements, or terms and conditions applicable to the subject matter of these Terms, except for what provided for under Article 3. These Terms create no third-party beneficiary rights.
