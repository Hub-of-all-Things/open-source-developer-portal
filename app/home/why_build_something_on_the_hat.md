# Why build something on the HAT

Businesses would otherwise have to plumb, combined all kinds of data sets from disparate sources as a number of underlining platform services, and made them available as a set of APIs so that every business can come into the HAT platform and deals with customer directly. Details see the [ecosystem architecture] (https://github.com/Hub-of-all-Things/HAT), and the [tools available](https://github.com/Hub-of-all-Things/HAT2.0).

Leveraging the tools and existing processes, now developers can focus on data exchange and engagement with HATs simply through a few API calls.
