This guide has covered the basics of HAT Data I/O, namely inserting new data and retrieving it as-is. The points we have not covered include:

- Consistently handling heterogeneous data - using _data combinators_ and _bundles_
- Managing data access by other users than the HAT owner - using _data debits_

For the details on these topics, check out the guides on [the power of HAT data bundling](../data-bundling) and [Data Debits for consented data sharing](../data-debits).
