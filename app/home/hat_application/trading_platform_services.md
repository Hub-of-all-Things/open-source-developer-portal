# Trading Platform Services

Trading Platform Services are offered by HATDeX and operate in the background of all trading platform applications. These services include: 

## Offer registration
HATDeX can register offers from a Trading Platform application and make registered offers available elsewhere in the ecosystem; 

## Offer status tracking 
HATDeX can report the status of data offers made by Trading Platform applications, including which an offer has been claimed or rejected by HAT Users; 

## Billing rules 
HATDeX can facilitate cross-platform billing, such as for offers onboarded from Platform A, but claimed via Platform B; 

## Data Debit requirement registration – HATDeX can take agreed Data Offers from Data Trading Platforms, configure Data Debit on HATs, and enable the full data exchange at the HAT level; 

## Data transaction stats – HATDex can track the meta data of a data transaction to update the status of active offers, and it can provide other statistics to trading platforms, including the tracking of offer acceptance, and data yield quantifications; 

## HAT/Data Offer matching control – HATDeX can maintain a buffer layer to support the offer matching designed by a Trading Platform Application. This control layer carries targeted user data from an offer down to a HAT, and compares the user’s profile against the availability of the HAT data for the data offer. If a match exists, the control layer can display the data offer to the HAT User.
