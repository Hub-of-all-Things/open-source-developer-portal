All SHE function management is performed through the endpoints to list, setup and disable the apps as well as in certain cases - get the application token for the frontend to use in authenticating with a remote service.


### Listing functions

Applications are listed at `/api/v2.6/she/function` - returns the full list of available functions

This method is the only one needed to call to get a comprehensive list of functions along with their status on the HAT (available, enabled, execution time).

An individual function information is accessible at `/api/v2.6/she/function/:function-id` but this shouldnâ€™t be needed in most cases. It will have exactly the same information and format as a single item in the list returned by `/api/v2.6/she/function`.

### Setting up

Function is set up by calling GET `/api/v2.6/she/function/:function-id/enable`

The steps of setting up a function with a HAT happen transparently after calling the `enable` endpoint.

Similarly a function gets disabled by calling `/api/v2.6/she/function/:function-id/disable`. This takes care of recording the fact on the HAT, disabling any HAT access and suspending future function invocations.

### Executing

Most functions are expected to be executed automatically by the HAT, however it is still possible (with "owner" HAT permissions) to execute a function manually by calling GET `/api/v2.6/she/function/:function-id/trigger`
